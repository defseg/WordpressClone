* New blog form
* Add HTML structure to templates
* Header
* Backbone auth?
* Notifications
* WARN: tilt autoloading 'ejs' in a non thread-safe way; explicit require 'ejs' suggested.
* fix "( comments)" display bug that occurs when you make a new post
* figure out how to get simple_format on the client side so display before and after reload isn't different
  or pull back the post from server on success...? no
* enforce simple_formatting serverside in the render? (will I need to?)
